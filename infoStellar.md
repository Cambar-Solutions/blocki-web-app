Stellar Hack+ at Stellar Week
Stellar Hack+ is the hackathon component of Stellar Week, a week-long builder program in Buenos Aires focused on technical development, ecosystem interoperability, and product growth. It brings together developers and founders from across LATAM to design, build, and deploy solutions using the Stellar stack.

The goal is not only to build prototypes, but to deliver measurable progress. Participants are expected to show clear technical advancement during the event, whether through new integrations, architecture improvements, or functional deployments that demonstrate the potential of Stellar in real-world contexts.

As part of the Stellar Lab, this edition of Stellar Hack+ will feature a ZK Morning, a series of sessions exploring how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can enhance privacy, scalability, and interoperability across the Stellar ecosystem. While there is no dedicated ZK track, projects that demonstrate understanding or future integration potential of ZK concepts will receive additional consideration during judging. This is not a decisive factor, but it can positively influence scoring in Innovation and Technical Sophistication, recognizing builders who align with Stellar’s long-term vision for advanced cryptography and scalability.

Track 1: Stellar Scale
This track is for projects already live or in advanced stages of development. The focus is on strengthening infrastructure, expanding capabilities, and improving integration across the Stellar ecosystem.

Teams should approach this track as an opportunity to evolve their product. Evaluation will consider the depth of new integrations, technical soundness, and how effectively the project improves performance, interoperability, or scalability. Projects can explore areas such as wallet infrastructure, liquidity systems, on/off-ramps, compliance tools, or other production-oriented components that enhance the utility and reliability of Stellar-based applications.

Prizes: 1st place $5,000 · 2nd place $2,000

Track 2: Stellar Genesis
This track is designed for builders developing early-stage projects or transforming initial concepts into working MVPs. The focus is on execution, taking an idea with clear relevance and turning it into a functional, technically sound prototype.

Teams can build new solutions or combine existing ecosystem tools to form novel applications. Evaluation will focus on code quality, technical architecture, and how well the project addresses concrete needs in LATAM. The strongest submissions will show potential for continuity and demonstrate a realistic pathway toward production after the hackathon.

Prizes: 1st place $5,000 · 2nd place $2,000

Special Awards
Innovation Award ($500) — for the project that achieves exceptional originality and technical execution, pushing the boundaries of what can be built within Stellar.

Integrator Award ($500) — for the project that best demonstrates composability by integrating other Stellar-based tools or collaborating with multiple ecosystem products.

Evaluation Framework
Each submission will be evaluated on technical merit, ecosystem relevance, and execution depth, with criteria adjusted to each track. Judges will include experienced builders, technical leads, and ecosystem contributors with expertise in product architecture, smart contracts, and Stellar integrations.

Track 1: Stellar Scale
Projects in this track will be evaluated on their ability to demonstrate measurable technical growth and interoperability.

Key evaluation areas include:

Architecture improvement: optimization of scalability, infrastructure, or system performance.
Integration depth: the quality and efficiency of new integrations with SDKs, APIs, or liquidity layers.
Technical sophistication: clarity of code structure, modularity, and robustness of implementation.
Ecosystem value: contribution to the ecosystem’s maturity or usefulness to other builders.
Progress delta: measurable technical evolution between the project’s initial and final states.
Judges will prioritize teams that utilize the hackathon to achieve higher production standards and enhance the ecosystem’s technical foundation.

Track 2: Stellar Genesis
Projects in this track will be evaluated on concept validation, execution quality, and potential for adoption within Stellar.

Key evaluation areas include:

Technical implementation: functionality, precision, and working logic of the MVP.
System design: soundness of architecture, including smart contracts, data flow, and integration strategy.
Use of Stellar tools: effective and meaningful application of SDKs, APIs, or ecosystem services.
Relevance: alignment with real user needs or challenges in LATAM.
Scalability potential: how the prototype could evolve into a sustainable solution.
Judges will value clean architecture, thoughtful engineering, and clear documentation that supports post-hackathon development.

ZK-Aware Evaluation Consideration
Projects that incorporate, reference, or demonstrate awareness of zero-knowledge (ZK) principles, such as privacy-preserving design, cryptographic scalability, or verifiable computation, may receive additional weighting in the Innovation and Technical Sophistication criteria. This is not a separate prize or standalone category but a complementary factor that can strengthen a project’s overall score and increase its chances of standing out within its track. Submissions that conceptually align with insights shared during the ZK Morning at Stellar Lab will be recognized for contributing to Stellar’s long-term vision of scalable and privacy-aware blockchain innovation.
